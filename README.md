## üìí Description :

- The Algorithm Visualizer is a web application designed to help users understand algorithms and data structures through interactive visualizations. Whether you're a student learning computer science concepts or a developer looking to refresh your knowledge, this tool provides a step-by-step animation of the algorithms to aid your understanding.

- The application features a user-friendly interface with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as the frontend technologies. You can easily navigate through the available algorithms using a dropdown menu. Additionally, the app supports version control with Git, enabling you to track changes and collaborate effectively.

- The algorithms and data structures are visually presented with animated steps, allowing you to grasp the underlying concepts more easily. You have the flexibility to pause the animation at any point, giving you time to analyze the current state of the algorithm. Alongside the animations, the app also provides concise information on each algorithm and data structure, giving you a brief overview of their purpose and functionality.

- To utilize the Algorithm Visualizer, simply select the desired algorithm from the dropdown menu. Depending on the algorithm, you may need to provide input, such as a list of words for trie and binary search tree. Once you've set the input, click the "Visualize" button to witness the algorithm in action. If you need more time to examine a particular step, you can pause the animation using the "Pause" button. Feel free to experiment and explore the various algorithms and data structures available.

- The application is hosted on Netlify or GitHub Pages, making it easily accessible to users. Its interactive and educational nature provides an engaging way to learn and reinforce your understanding of algorithms and data structures.
